        <h4>Recipe Instructions</h4>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Step 1</strong>  Stir together cucumber pieces and gochujang paste in a bowl; set aside.</p> 
                <p><strong>Step 2</strong>  Bring about 2 cups water to a boil in a large nonstick skillet and stir in spinach; cook until bright green and wilted, 2 to 3 minutes</p>
                <p><strong>Step 3</strong>  Drain spinach and squeeze out as much moisture as possible; set spinach aside in a bowl and stir in soy sauce.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 4</strong>  Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large nonstick skillet; cook and stir carrots until softened, about 3 minutes.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 5</strong>  Stir in garlic and cook just until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in cucumber mixture; sprinkle with red pepper flakes. Set carrot mixture aside in a bowl.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 6</strong>  Brown beef in a clean nonstick skillet over medium heat, about 5 minutes per side; set aside.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 7</strong> Heat remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in another nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Fry eggs just on one side until yolks are runny, but whites are firm, 2 to 4 minutes.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 8</strong>  Divide cooked rice into 4 large serving bowls; top with spinach mixture, a few pieces of beef, and cucumber mixture. Place 1 egg atop each serving. Drizzle each bowl with 1 teaspoon sesame oil, a sprinkle of sesame seeds, and a small amount of gochujang paste if desired.</p>
