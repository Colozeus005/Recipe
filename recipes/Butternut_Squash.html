    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>This is a thick, rich butternut squash soup with tons of flavor. Something I whipped up off the top of my head, with things I had on hand. Super easy, quick, and a great way to use squash. An instant hit at my house.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Butter</strong>: Here, the vegetables are saut√©ed in butter, although reviewers had success substituting with olive oil, too.</li>
            <li><strong>Onion, celery, carrots, and potatoes</strong>: These vegetables give body and depth of flavor to the soup, without overwhelming the squash. Once the vegetables are tender, you may use an immersion blender or blend them in batches using a standing blender to achieve a smooth, creamy texture.</li>
            <li><strong>Butternut squash</strong>: Use either one medium butternut squash (~2 pounds) or about 3 cups of pre-cut butternut squash.</li>
            <li><strong>Chicken stock</strong>: Chicken or vegetable stock makes up the base of this soup, and can be used to thin out the natural creaminess of the pureed vegetables. If you prefer a thicker soup, use less stock.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt and pepper</strong>: This recipe keeps things simple with just salt and pepper for seasoning. However, reviewers say it can be easily customized with spices of your choosing, including cayenne pepper, nutmeg, curry powder, sage, etc.</li>

        <h4>Recipe Instructions</h4>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Step 1</strong> Gather all ingredients.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 2</strong> Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat, and cook onion, celery, carrot, potatoes, and squash until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Pour in enough chicken stock to cover vegetables.</p> 
                <p><strong>Step 3</strong> Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low, cover pot, and simmer until all vegetables are tender, about 40 minutes.</p> 
                <p><strong>Step 4</strong> Transfer soup to a blender and process until smooth. Return to the pot and mix in any remaining stock to reach desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper.</p> 
                <p><strong>Step 5</strong> Serve hot and enjoy!</p>
